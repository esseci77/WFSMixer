/**
* Implementation of a filmstrip knob widget, similar to those popularized
* by the VSTGUI framework. This class requires a filmstrip knob image, which
* is a very tall image of with each knob rotation frame appended vertically
* after each other. See the "scripts" directory of the TeragonGuiComponents
* project for a script capable of generating filmstrips from a directory of
* knob animation frames.
*
* Juce does not have built-in support for filmstrip knobs, instead it opts
* for primitively-drawn rotated knobs (the word "primitive" here refers to
* graphics primitives, this is not a jab ot Juce's code sophistication).
* However, many plugin designers prefer filmstrip knobs because realistic
* shading can be done, giving the knob a more natural look. Even if shading
* is not desired, rotating a simple graphic will often result in "wiggle",
* which yields a poor-looking animation. Furthermore, filmstrip knobs are
* often very high-performance, since it is often quicker to paint a single
* pre-rendered image than it is to rotate an image on the fly.
*
* Other classes in the TeragonGuiComponents frameworks do not require the
* caller to pass in the image name, so for that reason subclasses of this
* base class exist simply to fill in the knob image name. This seems like
* overkill, but it greatly simplifies doing layout in Introjucer.
